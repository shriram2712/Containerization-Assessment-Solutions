STEPS :

BUILD AND RUN A DOCKER CONTAINER FOR NGINX 
1. Create a Dockerfile and add the commands to install nginx
2. Create the image using the command
	docker build -t shriram-a1-q1:latest .
3. After the image is created, build a container and map port 8080 to it
	docker run -dit -p 8080:80 shriram-a1-q1:latest

UPLOAD AN IMAGE TO DOCKER HUB
1. In the console login to DockerHub
2. Create a repository 
3. In the terminal log in to docker
4. Tag the image created in the last step as follows
	docker tag 1d0a35233731 shriram2712/shriram-a1-q1:latest
5. Push the image to DockerHub
	docker push shriram2712/shriram-a1-q1:latest
6. Now this image can be pulled and run as follows :
	docker run -dit -p 8080:80 shriram/shriram-a1-q1
   This will pull the latest image and run

UPLOAD AN IMAGE TO GCR
1. In the terminal, login to gcloud using the command
	gcloud auth login
   Set the project id
2. Tag the image created using the following command
	docker tag 1d0a35233731 asia.gcr.io/pe-training/shriram-q1-a1:latest
   where asia.gcr.io is the host name, pe traiining is the project and shriram-q1-a1 is the image tag
3. Push the image using the command
	docker push asia.gcr.io/pe-training/shriram-q1-a1:latest
4. Now this image can be pulled and run as follows :
	docker run -dit -p 8080:80 asia.gcr.io/pe-training/shriram-q1-a1:latest
	
UPLOAD AN IMAGE TO ECR (Using EC2 instance)
1. Create an EC2 instance with full access IAM role
2. Create a repo in ECR to upload the images to
3. SSH into the EC2 instance and install aws cli and docker in the instance.
4. Pull the image uploaded to dockerhub shown above using
	docker pull shriram2712/shriram-a1-q1:latestlatest: Pulling from shriram2712/shriram-a1-q1
5. Now login to AWS ECR using the command
	$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-1)
6. Tag the image using
	docker tag 1d0a35233731 488599217855.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/shriram-a1-q1:latest
7. Now push the image using
	docker push 488599217855.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/shriram-a1-q1:latest


RUNNING BASH ON NGINX CONTAINER
1. Once the container is created, run the command
	docker exec -it cranky_jang bash
2. Now a terminal opens and you can install nano using the command
	apt-get install nano
