STEPS :

BUILD AND RUN A DOCKER CONTAINER FOR NGINX 
1. Create a Dockerfile and add the commands to install nginx
2. Create the image using the command
	docker build -t shriram-a1-q1:latest .
3. After the image is created, build a container and map port 8080 to it
	docker run -dit -p 8080:80 shriram-a1-q1:latest

UPLOAD AN IMAGE TO DOCKER HUB
1. In the console login to DockerHub
2. Create a repository 
3. In the terminal log in to docker
4. Tag the image created in the last step as follows
	docker tag 1d0a35233731 shriram2712/shriram-a1-q1:latest
5. Push the image to DockerHub
	docker push shriram2712/shriram-a1-q1:latest
6. Now this image can be pulled and run as follows :
	docker run -dit -p 8080:80 shriram/shriram-a1-q1
   This will pull the latest image and run

UPLOAD AN IMAGE TO GCR
1. In the terminal, login to gcloud using the command
	gcloud auth login

2. Tag the image created using the following command
	docker tag 1d0a35233731 asia.gcr.io/pe-training/shriram-q1-a1:latest
   where asia.gcr.io is the host name, pe traiining is the project and shriram-q1-a1 is the image tag
3. Push the image using the command
	docker push asia.gcr.io/pe-training/shriram-q1-a1:latest
4. Now this image can be pulled and run as follows :
	docker run -dit -p 8080:80 asia.gcr.io/pe-training/shriram-q1-a1:latest
